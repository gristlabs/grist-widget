    <h3 id="-chili-s-and-barnes-noble-top-the-ranking-"><strong>Chili’s and Barnes &amp; Noble Top the Ranking</strong></h3>
    <p>We’ve <a href="https://www.placer.ai/blog/chilis-and-texas-roadhouse-full-service-success-in-2024">written</a> <a href="https://www.placer.ai/blog/checking-in-with-full-service-restaurants-first-watch-chilis-and-outback-steakhouse">extensively</a> <a href="https://www.placer.ai/blog/placer-100-retail-dining-index-a-robust-holiday-season">about</a> Chili’s ongoing success, so it came as no surprise that the casual dining chain topped the Placer 100 chart again in January 2025: Overall visits and visits per location grew a whopping 29.3% and 30.2%, respectively, compared to January 2024. Barnes &amp; Noble has also been <a href="https://www.placer.ai/blog/barnes-noble-writing-a-new-story">thriving</a> for a <a href="https://www.placer.ai/blog/placer-100-retail-dining-index-strong-kickoff-to-the-holiday-season">while</a>, and the legacy bookseller continued its winning streak with double-digit growth in both overall visits and visits per location in the first month of 2025.</p>
    <p>Other notable chart-toppers from January 2025 include LA Fitness, which has been <a href="https://athletechnews.com/la-fitness-members-grapple-with-closures-loss-of-cycling-class/">rightsizing</a> its fleet and closing locations throughout the country, leading to a 8.1% year-over-year (YoY) increase in average visits per location. CVS, which <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cvs-closing-hundreds-stores-end-121200619.html">closed</a> numerous venues in 2024 as well, has also seen its average visits per location shoot up.</p>

    <h3 id="-placer-100-january-2025-spotlight-warby-parker-"><strong>Placer 100 January 2025 Spotlight: Warby Parker</strong></h3>
    <p>Like Chili’s and Barnes &amp; Noble, Warby Parker was among the January 2025 top 10 growth chains for both overall visits and visits per venue. The company is opening stores at a rapid rate with the long-term <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jennmcmillen/2024/08/26/the-optics-behind-warby-parkers-600-store-expansion-plan/">goal</a> of 900 brick-and-mortar stores nationwide.</p>
    <p>Warby is an expert in omnichannel integration, and the company <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/08/08/warby-parker-wrby-q2-2024-earnings-call-transcript/">continues</a> to enhance the online customer experience even as it builds up a brick-and-mortar empire. And analyzing the brand’s January 2025 metrics along with its 2024 performance – when overall visits increased 16.8% while average visits per venue remained steady – reveals that this investment in both its physical and digital channels is paying off.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/11/08/warby-parker-wrby-q3-2024-earnings-call-transcript/">According</a> to co-CEO and co-founder Dave Gilboa, brick-and-mortar venues accounted for around 70% of Warby Parker’s revenue as of Q3 2024 – an increase from 67% in Q3 2023 – though many customers who initially bought in-store made subsequent purchases online. This showcases the customer acquisition potential of physical stores, especially for companies who succeed in integrating and creating synergy between their offline and online presence. And some of Warby’s <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/08/08/warby-parker-wrby-q2-2024-earnings-call-transcript/">strongest</a> e-commerce growth has taken place in metro areas where the brand has a significant physical presence – emphasizing the role that brick-and-mortar venues play in raising brand awareness and strengthening consumer engagement.</p>
    <p>It seems, then, that Warby Parker&#39;s strategic offline expansion is not only driving in-store sales but also fueling online growth – demonstrating the powerful interplay between brick-and-mortar locations and digital engagement in strengthening customer loyalty and brand visibility.</p>
