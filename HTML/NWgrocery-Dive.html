    <p>The nationwide grocery category <a href="https://go.placer.ai/wp/placer-ai-quarterly-index-q1-2023">suffered</a> a setback in recent months, as inflation led many consumers to tighten their belts and seek out off-price retailers. And even though food prices have finally begun to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/10/business/food-prices-inflation.html#:~:text=Prices%20for%20food%20at%20home,they%20were%20before%20the%20pandemic.">stabilize</a>, they remain significantly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/10/business/food-prices-inflation.html#:~:text=Prices%20for%20food%20at%20home,they%20were%20before%20the%20pandemic.">higher</a> than they were last year. </p>
    <p>But the state of grocery varies considerably across regions. So with the second quarter of 2023 underway, we continued making the <a href="https://www.placer.ai/blog/northeastern-usa-grocery-dive">regional</a> <a href="https://www.placer.ai/blog/many-ways-to-win-midwest-grocery-deep-dive">grocery</a> rounds, focusing this time on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwestern_United_States#:~:text=The%20Northwestern%20United%20States%2C%20also,Southeast%20Alaska%20in%20the%20Northwest.">Northwest</a> – an area encompassing Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, and Wyoming.</p>
    <h3 id="albertsons-the-statewide-winner">Albertsons: The Statewide Winner</h3>
    <p><a href="https://www.albertsons.com/">Albertsons</a> topped the list as the most popular grocery banner in three out of five Northwestern states: Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming. <a href="https://www.safeway.com/">Safeway</a>, also owned by <a href="https://www.albertsonscompanies.com/home/default.aspx">Albertsons Companies, Inc.</a>, was the most-visited grocery chain in Washington. And <a href="https://www.fredmeyer.com/">Fred Meyer</a>, owned by <a href="https://www.thekrogerco.com/">The Kroger Company,</a> enjoyed the highest visit share in Oregon. With an Albertsons-Kroger <a href="https://www.krogeralbertsons.com/">merger</a> in the <a href="https://www.placer.ai/blog/kroger-and-albertsons-a-merging-of-strengths">works</a>, the two companies appear poised to lead the Northwest grocery space in tandem.</p>

    <h3 id="but-the-overall-regional-leader-is-safeway">But the Overall Regional Leader is Safeway</h3>
    <p>But as we’ve <a href="https://www.placer.ai/blog/many-ways-to-win-midwest-grocery-deep-dive">pointed out</a>, topping the statewide lists isn’t everything. In many areas, the second- and third-place grocery banners also command a significant portion of the overall visit share. A deeper dive into the most popular supermarkets across the region shows that four banners dominate the local grocery scene: Albertsons, Fred Meyers, Safeway, and <a href="https://www.wincofoods.com/">WinCO Foods</a>. And looking at the overall regional breakdown of visit share reveals Safeway as the overall regional winner.  </p>
    <div class="infogram-embed" data-id="_/hCIQavkz3RiK6AVwyZKQ" data-type="interactive" data-title="Safeway Leads the Northwest Grocery Scene"></div><script>!function(e,n,i,s){var d="InfogramEmbeds";var o=e.getElementsByTagName(n)[0];if(window[d]&&window[d].initialized)window[d].process&&window[d].process();else if(!e.getElementById(i)){var r=e.createElement(n);r.async=1,r.id=i,r.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,"script","infogram-async","https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js");</script>
    <h3 id="winco-leading-the-way-for-off-price">WinCo: Leading the Way for Off-Price</h3>
    <p>The success of WinCo Foods, the privately-held, <a href="https://www.wincofoods.com/about/an-employee-owned-company">employee-owned</a> grocery chain with some <a href="https://www.scrapehero.com/location-reports/WinCo%20Foods-USA/">139 locations</a> across 10 states – including 66 in the Northwest – shows that smaller brands can also win at the regional grocery game. Based in Boise, ID, WinCo keeps prices <a href="https://www.tasteofhome.com/article/why-are-people-going-crazy-over-winco-foods/#:~:text=With%20super%20low%20costs%20and,for%20this%20growing%20grocery%20chain.">low</a> by buying directly from farmers and manufacturers and providing a no-frills shopping experience: Customers <a href="https://www.wincofoods.com/customer-service/in-store-services#:~:text=Please%20note%2C%20WinCo%20does%20not,our%20uniform%20check%20cashing%20policy.">can’t pay</a> by credit card, and they have to <a href="https://www.tastingtable.com/1231435/most-affordable-grocery-stores/">bag their own groceries</a>. Most locations are <a href="https://www.tastingtable.com/1231435/most-affordable-grocery-stores/">open</a> 24 hours a day, and many products can be purchased in <a href="https://www.thedailymeal.com/americas-best-supermakets/">bulk</a>.</p>
    <p>And WinCo’s low-cost strategy seems to be paying off. Since the beginning of the year, WinCo has greatly <a href="https://go.placer.ai/wp/placer-ai-quarterly-index-q1-2023">outperformed</a> the nationwide grocery sector, with year-over-year (YoY) visits up nearly across the board, partly due to the chain’s continued <a href="https://www.winsightgrocerybusiness.com/topics/winco-opens-its-138th-store">expansion</a>. While the chain doesn’t rank as the top grocery retailer for any of the analyzed states, its regional visit share stood at 10.9% in April 2023, making it the third-most-visited banner in the region. </p>
    <div class="infogram-embed" data-id="_/AcxBq0nR5jPPz7er3Evn" data-type="interactive" data-title="Visits to WinCo Foods by State, Compared to 2022"></div><script>!function(e,n,i,s){var d="InfogramEmbeds";var o=e.getElementsByTagName(n)[0];if(window[d]&&window[d].initialized)window[d].process&&window[d].process();else if(!e.getElementById(i)){var r=e.createElement(n);r.async=1,r.id=i,r.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,"script","infogram-async","https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js");</script>
    <p> The data also suggests that WinCo customers may be more likely than those of other regional grocery leaders to engage in <a href="https://www.placer.ai/blog/walmart-target-wholesalers-in-q1-2023">mission-driven</a> shopping. Analyzing the daily visit breakdown for leading groceries in Idaho, Washington, Oregon, and Montana – the four Northwestern states that <a href="https://www.scrapehero.com/location-reports/WinCo%20Foods-USA/">boast</a> a <a href="https://www.wincofoods.com/stores/">WinCo</a> – shows that a larger share of WinCo visitors frequent the store on weekends. And WinCo customers tend to remain in-store significantly longer than visitors to other leading food retailers: median dwell time at WinCo stores across the analyzed states ranged from 32-35 minutes, compared to 26-29 minutes for other leading regional grocers. Customers appear to be flocking to the low-priced chain on weekends, when they have more time to browse the aisles and stock up on discount goods.</p>
    <div class="infogram-embed" data-id="_/esHPqEMPU0FgYedZJei1" data-type="interactive" data-title="WinCo is Emerging as a Popular Regional Destination for More Leisurely Weekend Visits 2023"></div><script>!function(e,n,i,s){var d="InfogramEmbeds";var o=e.getElementsByTagName(n)[0];if(window[d]&&window[d].initialized)window[d].process&&window[d].process();else if(!e.getElementById(i)){var r=e.createElement(n);r.async=1,r.id=i,r.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,"script","infogram-async","https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js");</script>
    <h3 id="key-takeaways">Key Takeaways</h3>
    <p>While several big chains dominate the nationwide grocery scene, food shopping remains a highly localized affair. For <a href="https://www.placer.ai/blog/grocery-update-zooming-in-on-the-lone-star-state">Texans</a>, there’s nothing quite like H-E-B, and Northeasterners can’t get enough <a href="https://www.placer.ai/blog/northeastern-usa-grocery-dive">Stop &amp; Shop</a>. In the Northwest, Albertsons banners win the day, with Kroger’s Fred Meyer close behind. But the significant growth experienced by employee-owned WinCo shows that there’s plenty of room for smaller players in the grocery space – especially those that offer inflation-wary shoppers low-cost alternatives.  </p>
