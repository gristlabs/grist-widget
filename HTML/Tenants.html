<p>January 30, 2025</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62d64ff33158a9a2aba96531/679b3aa2ce799642129932d8_Shutterstock_2074196111.jpg" alt="Burlington Stores - Scooping up Bed Bath and Beyond’s Real Estate"></p>
<p>They say that one man’s trash is another one’s treasure – and for Burlington Stores, opportunity knocked when Bed Bath &amp; Beyond selected Burlington Stores as the successful bidder for many of its leases, with the latter taking over 44 locations for $12 million. Per <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/29/burlington-stores-will-replace-bed-bath-beyond-locations.html">CNBC</a>, many of these new venues are scattered across the country.</p>
<p>Using Placer data, we are able to compare visitation trends to these locations when they were branded as a Bed Bath &amp; Beyond store versus when the new leases took over.</p>
<p>Whereas the top four segments have remained consistent for both banners, Burlington attracts a higher proportion of Melting Pot Families - over 2x the rate compared to when it was a Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.</p>

<script src="https://embedded-widget.placer.ai/ew.js" async></script><iframe src="https://embedded-widget.placer.ai/widgets/v1/editorial/?type=infogram&id=_%2FeZydPPPO6wM1VCcnyhMu&title=Burlington+Attracts+Melting+Pot+Families+at+2x+vs.+Bed+Bath+%26+Beyond&tag=undefined" loading="lazy" title="Burlington Attracts Melting Pot Families at 2x vs. Bed Bath & Beyond" allowfullscreen="true" allow="clipboard-write" referrerpolicy="origin" scrolling="no" style="border: 1px solid rgb(229, 229, 229); border-radius: 8px; width:100%;height:600px;"></iframe>

<p>The number of visits across numerous visit durations was considerably higher to Burlington, and the average dwell time increased to 41 minutes compared to 31 minutes when it was a Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.</p>

<script src="https://embedded-widget.placer.ai/ew.js" async></script><iframe src="https://embedded-widget.placer.ai/widgets/v1/editorial/?type=infogram&id=_%2FPg6xRamLRsbfAsKMjVEZ&title=Average+Dwell+Time+increased+10+min+upon+change+to+Burlington&tag=undefined" loading="lazy" title="Average Dwell Time increased 10 min upon change to Burlington" allowfullscreen="true" allow="clipboard-write" referrerpolicy="origin" scrolling="no" style="border: 1px solid rgb(229, 229, 229); border-radius: 8px; width:100%;height:600px;"></iframe>

<p>While this is just one example of a Burlington takeover, it goes to show that while the location may stay the same, the audience it attracts  will vary and this Burlington is off to an excellent start.</p>

<p>Key Takeaways</p>
<ul>
<li>Year-over-year (YoY) foot traffic to <strong>McDonald’s</strong> was mixed in 2024, with most months experiencing minor lags in visits relative to 2023. Still, the restaurant outperformed the wider quick-service restaurant (QSR) segment in all months analyzed. </li>
<li><strong>McDonald’s</strong> used limited-time offers (LTOs) to great effect throughout 2024, with its <strong>Chicken Big Mac</strong> release driving the largest and most sustained visit boost relative to 2024’s average weekly visits. </li>
<li><strong>Chipotle</strong> outperformed the wider fast-casual segment, experiencing YoY visit growth in all months analyzed. </li>
<li><strong>Chipotle’s</strong> expansion has met a ready demand as new venues seem to fill up fast – all but eight states in the continental U.S. showed growth in visits per location in 2024 relative to 2023.</li>
</ul>
<p>How have McDonald’s and Chipotle, two of the most recognizable names in the quick-service and fast-casual dining scenes, fared over the last year? We take a closer look at each chain’s visit performance, and highlight some bright spots of 2024. </p>
<h3 id="mcdonald-s-visits-vary-outperform-overall-qsr">McDonald’s: Visits Vary, Outperform Overall QSR</h3>
<p>Visits to McDonald’s were mixed throughout 2024, with most months seeing minor visitation lags relative to 2023. Still, YoY traffic trends outpaced those of the overall QSR segment in all but one month (October 2024), highlighting the chain’s power relative to the rest of the market. </p>

<h3 id="specials-drive-visits">Specials Drive Visits</h3>
<p>Some of the visitation dips at both McDonald&#39;s and the overall QSR segment are likely due to inflation impacting prices across the dining industry. And the rise of the budget-conscious consumer has prompted many chains to lean on limited-time offers and special releases to both offer affordable deals and turn a trip to a QSR into a special occasion. McDonald’s capitalized on this trend, driving <a href="https://www.placer.ai/blog/limited-time-offers-price-wars-boost-visits">impressive</a> visit boosts following the June launch of its $5 Meal Deal. However, it was the chain’s special releases that delivered the most significant increases in weekly visits.</p>
<p>The introduction of the <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/03/food/mcdonalds-chicken-big-mac/index.html">Chicken Big Mac</a> on October 10th, 2024 proved to be a major success, driving a 7.2% increase in visits during the week of the launch (October 7th-13th) and an even larger 8.7% increase in the first full week following the release (October 14th-20th). The chain also enjoyed a jump in foot traffic from its limited-edition collector’s meal, <a href="https://www.scrippsnews.com/life/food-and-drink/mcdonalds-launches-limited-edition-collectors-meal-heres-whats-inside">launched</a> on August 12th, 2024, further highlighting the effectiveness of these strategic, <a href="https://www.placer.ai/blog/mcdonalds-and-chipotles-post-pandemic-success">nostalgia</a>-driven releases.</p>

<h3 id="chipotle-wrapping-up-another-impressive-year">Chipotle: Wrapping Up Another Impressive Year</h3>
<p>Chipotle has been a fast-casual darling for several years now, consistently driving YoY visit growth and expanding into new markets. And 2024 was no exception for the chain, with visits growing in all months analyzed. This included an impressive 21.1% year-over-year increase in April 2024, followed by sustained growth throughout the remainder of the year, culminating in an 8.8% increase in December 2024 compared to 2023. In contrast, the broader fast-casual category saw much more muted visitation patterns. </p>

<script src="https://embedded-widget.placer.ai/ew.js" async></script><iframe src="https://embedded-widget.placer.ai/widgets/v1/editorial/?type=infogram&id=_%2FzRhjlZ8zgsj00KkZb5Pw&title=Chipotle+Continues+to+Drive+Impressive+YoY+Visit+Growth+in+2024%2C+Outpaces+Wider+Fast-Casual+Category&tag=undefined" loading="lazy" title="Chipotle Continues to Drive Impressive YoY Visit Growth in 2024, Outpaces Wider Fast-Casual Category" allowfullscreen="true" allow="clipboard-write" referrerpolicy="origin" scrolling="no" style="border: 1px solid rgb(229, 229, 229); border-radius: 8px; width:100%;height:600px;"></iframe>

<h3 id="growing-across-the-country">Growing Across The Country</h3>
<p>Some of Chipotle’s visit growth can be attributed to the aggressive growth strategy the company has undertaken, opening <a href="https://www.costar.com/article/2005466952/chipotle-on-track-to-open-record-number-of-stores-during-rough-year-for-restaurants">approximately</a> 300 stores in 2024 with plans to add another 300 locations in 2025. A significant part of this expansion strategy focuses on rural and suburban markets in a bid to capture untapped demand beyond traditional urban hubs.</p>
<p>And diving into visits per location reveals that, overall, this strategy is working. All but eight states analyzed showed YoY visit per location growth in 2024 – and five of the top ten states for visits per location growth are among the <a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/state-densities">least</a> densely populated in the country. This suggests that Chipotle&#39;s decision to target smaller markets is paying off, enabling the brand to attract new audiences while reinforcing its stronghold in more densely populated areas.</p>

<p>Key Takeaways</p>
<ul>
<li>Visits to <strong>RBI</strong> and <strong>Yum! Brands</strong> in 2024 were 0.9% lower and 0.3% higher, respectively, than they were in 2023. </li>
<li>On a quarterly basis, visits to <strong>Yum! Brands</strong> were generally up in 2024, with Q4 2024 seeing a year-over-year (YoY) 0.8% increase in visits and 1.6% growth in visits per location</li>
<li>Overall quarterly visits to <strong>RBI</strong> banners hovered at or just below 2023 levels for most of 2024.</li>
<li>RBI’s <strong>Popeye’s</strong> continued to ride the wave of chicken sandwich success, with visits elevated for most of 2024, and coffee chain <strong>Tim Horton’s</strong> also experienced YoY visit growth in H1 2024.</li>
<li>Yum! Brands <strong>Taco Bell</strong> &amp; <strong>Pizza Hut</strong> enjoyed consistent visit growth in all quarters of 2024, likely buoyed by successful promotions and limited-time offers. </li>
</ul>
<p>RBI and Yum! Brands own and operate some of the country’s most beloved and well-known dining chains. We took a look at the visit data for 2024 to see how the two companies fared in a period of economic headwinds and uncertainty. </p>
<h3 id="dining-leaders">Dining Leaders</h3>
<p>Restaurant Brands International (RBI) and Yum! Brands are leaders in the fast food and fast casual dining segment. Each company operates four restaurants with major footprints across the country – RBI owns Tim Hortons, Burger King, Firehouse Subs, and Popeyes, and Yum! manages Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, KFC, and The Habit Burger Grill.</p>
<p>Yum! Brands enjoyed visit and visits per location growth in all but one quarter, capping off Q4 2024 with an 0.8% increase in visits and a 1.6% increase in visits per location on a YoY basis. RBI’s visits and visits per location, meanwhile, hovered at or just below 2023’s levels in all but one quarter of the year, highlighting the challenges facing the dining segment in 2024.</p>

<h3 id="mixed-visits-popeye-s-stands-out">Mixed Visits, Popeye’s Stands Out</h3>
<p>Of the four RBI brands, Popeyes enjoyed the strongest visitation patterns throughout 2024.The chain has been a standout for the past few years – likely owing to its popular <a href="https://www.placer.ai/blog/popeyes-and-burger-king-lead-the-way">chicken sandwiches</a> – and Popeyes performed well in 2024 as well, with YoY visit growth during most quarters. </p>
<p>Following Popeyes in visit growth was Tim Hortons – Canada’s leading coffee chain – which saw positive momentum in the first half of 2024, though visits dipped in the latter half of the year. And though Burger King’s visits were sluggish, the chain has been focusing on optimizing its store fleets with <a href="https://www.placer.ai/blog/rbi-and-yum-qsr-resilience-in-2024">strong</a> results.</p>
<p>While overall visits across RBI’s brands were slightly below 2023 levels, their ability to remain close to last year’s numbers – and even achieve growth in some quarters – signals resilience. </p>

<h3 id="yum-brands-promotions-boost-visits">Yum! Brands: Promotions Boost Visits</h3>
<p>Yum! Brands delivered a strong performance in 2024, buoyed by Pizza Hut and Taco Bell’s consistent growth. Taco Bell in particular stood out, driving foot traffic through promotions like its highly popular <a href="https://www.placer.ai/blog/serving-summer-2024-rbi-and-yum-brands-q2-foot-traffic">Taco Tuesday</a> special. The chain experienced quarterly YoY visit growth throughout the year, culminating in a 2.1% increase in Q4 2024 relative to 2023.</p>
<p>Pizza Hut also experienced impressive visitation growth in 2024, especially in Q2. In contrast, KFC faced challenges with declining visits, while The Habit Burger Grill’s traffic remained steady, closely tracking 2023 levels. </p>

<h3 id="stabilizing-visits-room-for-growth">Stabilizing Visits, Room For Growth</h3>
<p>RBI and Yum! Brands experienced ups and downs throughout 2024, with some of their chains thriving while others showed modest visit declines. </p>
<p>With the new year well underway, how might RBI and Yum! work to drive increased visits to their restaurants?</p>

<p>Key Takeaways</p>
<ul>
<li>Foot traffic to <strong>Chipotle, Wingstop</strong>, and <strong>Shake Shack</strong> continued to impress in Q3 2024, with year-over-year (YoY) quarterly visits elevated by 12.7% at <strong>Chipotle</strong>, 24.2% at <strong>Wingstop</strong>, and 18.7% at <strong>Shake Shack.</strong></li>
<li>The average number of visits to each chain’s individual restaurants also increased YoY in Q3 – 11.9% for <strong>Chipotle</strong>, 4.3% for <strong>Wingstop</strong>, and 1.4% for <strong>Shake Shack</strong>. </li>
<li>Much of the chains’ visit growth is being driven by diners who prefer to eat off-site – In Q3 2024, short visits (10 minutes or less) to <strong>Chipotle, Wingstop</strong>, and <strong>Shake Shack</strong> increased between 17.0% and 25.5% compared to Q3 2023.</li>
</ul>
<p>Chipotle, Wingstop, and Shake Shack have emerged as restaurant leaders, thriving and outperforming the wider fast-casual and quick-service restaurant (QSR) categories. How did these chains perform in Q3 2024? We dove into the data to find out. </p>
<h3 id="foot-traffic-shows-no-signs-of-slowing">Foot Traffic Shows No Signs Of Slowing</h3>
<p>Chipotle, Wingstop, and Shake Shack have become some of the most popular dining chains in the nation, each within its own respective niche: Chipotle excels at health-focused Tex-Mex meals, Wingstop serves up chicken wings and other game-day style dishes, and Shake Shack is known for its burgers and frozen custards. All three chains are leaning into growing demand for their offerings by <a href="https://ir.chipotle.com/2024-07-24-CHIPOTLE-ANNOUNCES-SECOND-QUARTER-2024-RESULTS#:~:text=Results%20for%20the%20three%20months,the%20second%20quarter%20of%202023.">adding</a> <a href="https://ir.wingstop.com/wingstop-inc-reports-fiscal-second-quarter-2024-financial-results/">new</a> <a href="https://investor.shakeshack.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2024/Shake-Shack-Announces-Second-Quarter-2024-Financial-Results/default.aspx">restaurants</a> at a brisk clip. And for all three, the investment in fleet expansion is paying off, driving double-digit YoY visit growth.  </p>
<p>Of the three chains, Wingstop enjoyed the strongest YoY growth between June and September of this year, with visits rising 16.5% to 33.5% throughout the analyzed period. Shake Shack, for its part, saw visits increase between 12.4% and 25.9%. Meanwhile, Chipotle, <a href="https://www.placer.ai/blog/mcdonalds-and-chipotles-post-pandemic-success">continuing</a> <a href="https://www.placer.ai/blog/mcdonalds-and-chipotles-winning-recipe">several years</a> of visit growth, posted 10.0% to 12.9% YoY boosts. In contrast, the overall quick-service and fast-casual restaurant segments saw much more muted performance, with QSR visits hovering at or slightly below 2023 levels and fast-casual segments seeing modest visit upticks.</p>

<h3 id="visit-per-locations-show-similar-growth-patterns">Visit Per Locations Show Similar Growth Patterns</h3>
<p>One key driver behind the significant foot traffic growth for these three chains is their aggressive expansion. Wingstop, which saw the largest year-over-year (YoY) increase in foot traffic, opened <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91189106/wingstop-opening-new-restaurant-locations-2024-list-chains-growth">some 138</a> new restaurants in 2024 alone, and hopes to open around 300 by year’s end. Chipotle has also been expanding rapidly, with around 52 <a href="https://www.eatthis.com/chipotle-major-changes-2024/#:~:text=Rapid%20Expansion&amp;text=The%20chain%20expects%20to%20open,stores%20it%20debuted%20in%202023.">new</a> stores in 2024 so far and <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/losangeles/news/2024/07/24/chipotle-booming-expansion-plans.html">more</a> on the way. Shake Shack, aiming to open <a href="https://www.aol.com/shake-shack-plans-open-80-152315778.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAANebs1RoAw92KA2-mlS8iTNGTEMiEZ-lraIeH5H3y4TgUd_MoApH2w4738UED_GlG4_IhRA0PhzgY4oH4-RgWJXPLXPAv5sCCaXzqk3hCOnfR3-qXlJHbulsZK_VRWnx7Qd7EKE1NO6AZzG_ILq3rYEhRbSf5fSRjb4Hh1W3x0hH">80 new locations</a> this year, is similarly focused on growth.</p>
<p>A closer look at shifts in the average number of visits to the chains’ individual locations shows that this expansion is being met with strong demand. Chipotle and Wingstop saw monthly YoY visit-per-location increases throughout the analyzed period, while Shake Shack saw increases between June and August and experienced just a minor dip in September. </p>
<p>These foot traffic trends – both across the chains and at individual locations – indicate that the new stores are successfully attracting steady customer interest.</p>
<p><script src="https://embedded-widget.placer.ai/ew.js" async></script><iframe src="https://embedded-widget.placer.ai/widgets/v1/editorial/?type=infogram&id=_%2Fmiunv4A0LLmvU2phyAhr&tag=blog_%7BChipotle%2C+Wingstop%2C+and+Shake+Shack+Enjoy+Elevated+Monthly+Visits+Per+Location+Throughout+2024%7D" loading="lazy" title="Article Insights Graph" allowfullscreen="true" allow="clipboard-write" referrerpolicy="origin" scrolling="no" style="border: 1px solid rgb(229, 229, 229); border-radius: 8px; width:100%;height:600px;"></iframe></p>
<h3 id="short-visits-drive-more-growth">Short Visits Drive More Growth</h3>
<p>Another key factor driving success for the three chains is their pivot towards convenient takeaway options. <a href="https://www.barrons.com/amp/articles/chipotle-starbucks-mcdonalds-quick-restaurants-drive-throughs-3d7ac4f0">Chipotle</a> has focused on expanding its Chipotlane drive-thru service, while <a href="https://www.qsrmagazine.com/story/wingstops-proprietary-digital-platform-is-almost-here/">Wingstop</a> has invested in an in-store digital <a href="https://www.nrn.com/technology/wingstop-week-starts-rollout-mywingstop-platform">platform</a> meant to streamline the ordering process. And despite Shake Shack’s <a href="https://www.wsj.com/video/series/the-economics-of/shake-shackthe-anti-fast-food-chainturns-to-drive-thru-as-it-expands/CF2CEACE-D03B-4547-BD3F-60E8E29A92C7">“anti fast-food”</a> identity, the chain has also <a href="https://www.wsj.com/video/series/the-economics-of/shake-shackthe-anti-fast-food-chainturns-to-drive-thru-as-it-expands/CF2CEACE-D03B-4547-BD3F-60E8E29A92C7">embraced</a> drive-thrus and ordering kiosks to speed up service. </p>
<p>The data suggests that consumers appreciate the increased convenience of these quicker  options: In Q3 2024, short visits (10 minutes or less) to Chipotle, Wingstop, and Shake Shack surged between 17.0% and 25.5% compared to Q3 2023. </p>
<p>For Chipotle and Shake Shack, short visits increased significantly more than extended ones in Q3, likely due in part to the brands’ intense focus on drive-thrus: Of the 271 restaurants opened by Chipotle in 2023, 238 <a href="https://www.restaurantdive.com/news/chipotle-on-pace-1000-chipotlanes-2024/706791/">included</a> Chipotlanes. And since adding its <a href="https://www.qsrmagazine.com/slideshow/take-tour-shake-shacks-first-drive-thru/">first</a> drive-thru in 2022, Shake Shack has expanded this option to more than <a href="https://www.wsj.com/video/series/the-economics-of/shake-shackthe-anti-fast-food-chainturns-to-drive-thru-as-it-expands/CF2CEACE-D03B-4547-BD3F-60E8E29A92C7">thirty</a> locations. For Wingstop, longer visits increased somewhat more YoY than shorter ones – but in the wake of the chain’s rapid expansion, short and long visits both increased more than 20% YoY. </p>

<p>Key Takeaways</p>
<ul>
<li>Despite the ongoing consumer headwinds impacting discretionary spending, 2024 visits to both <strong>Starbucks</strong> and <strong>Dunkin</strong>’ remained close to 2023 levels.</li>
<li><strong>Dunkin’</strong> dominated early morning visits – receiving 39.9% of its visitors between 6:00 and 9:59 AM – while <strong>Starbucks</strong> led in evening visits, capturing 23.7% of its customers during the 3:00 to 6:59 PM daypart.</li>
<li><strong>Starbucks</strong> leveraged LTOs and retail milestones to drive visits, with <strong>Red Cup Day</strong>, <strong>Mother’s Day</strong>, and <strong>BOGO</strong> (Buy One Get One) offers driving visits up relative to the 2024 daily visit average. </li>
<li>The vast majority of visits to <strong>Starbucks</strong> are under 10 minutes – but recent initiatives may drive longer visits in 2025. </li>
</ul>
<p>Overall food-away-from-home spending <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2024/october/u-s-consumers-increased-spending-on-food-away-from-home-in-2023-driving-overall-food-spending-growth/">grew</a> in 2024, driven by decelerating inflation and a robust economy that eased budgetary concerns. How did coffee chains, one of the largest discretionary food categories, perform? </p>
<p>We took a closer look at foot traffic to Starbucks and Dunkin’ to find out.</p>

<h3 id="yearly-visits-perking-up-">Yearly Visits Perking Up?</h3>
<p>Despite the ongoing consumer <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/consumer-packaged-goods/our-insights/the-value-now-consumer-making-sense-of-us-consumer-sentiment-and-spending">uncertainty</a>, 2024 visits to Starbucks and Dunkin’ remained close to 2023 levels. The traffic trends range from 2.9% down year-over-year (YoY) to 1.9% up YoY for Starbucks, and from 1.3% down to 1.9% up YoY for Dunkin’ – a testament to coffee’s enduring draw.</p>
<h3 id="daily-grind">Daily Grind</h3>
<p>While the YoY visit patterns to Starbucks and Dunkin’ were relatively similar in 2024, the two chains experienced distinct visitation patterns throughout the day. During the early morning daypart (6:00 - 9:59 AM), Dunkin’ attracted 39.9% of its visitors, while Starbucks received only 29.9% of its customers before 10 AM. However, as the day transitioned into evening, Starbucks took the lead, capturing 23.7% of visitors during the 3:00 - 6:59 PM daypart, significantly higher than Dunkin’s 16.4%. </p>
<p>These visitation patterns highlight distinct opportunities for both chains to expand their appeal across different dayparts. Dunkin’ could offer afternoon specials to attract more visitors in the afternoon and evening daypart, and Starbucks could broaden its breakfast offerings to capture a larger share of the early morning crowd. </p>

<h3 id="starbucks-lto-success">Starbucks’ LTO Success</h3>
<p>A closer look at Starbucks’ daily visitation patterns highlights the chain’s mastery in leveraging calendar events and special promotions to boost foot traffic. Events like <a href="https://www.placer.ai/blog/starbucks-red-cup-day-makes-a-comeback">Red Cup Day</a> and <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/food/2024/05/10/starbucks-50-off-summer-app-y-days-beverage-deals/73640395007/">buy-one-get-one-free</a> (BOGO) deals, including on <a href="https://www.trendhunter.com/trends/starbucks-mothers-day">Mother’s Day</a>, drove impressive visits bumps ranging from 28.1% to 40.4% higher than the 2024 daily visit average.</p>
<p>These promotions appear to have been so successful that Starbucks, under the leadership of new C.E.O. Brian Niccol, announced it would <a href="https://www.mensjournal.com/news/starbucks-cutting-back-discounts-promotions">scale them back</a> – in part to restore the chain’s “<a href="https://www.today.com/food/news/starbucks-scales-back-discounts-promos-rcna175551">coffeehouse roots</a>” and avoid <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/14/business/starbucks-deals-promos-endings/index.html">over-crowded stores</a> on promotion days. But even without special discounts in the last five weeks of the year, Starbucks still received major traffic spikes on key shopping days like Super Saturday and Black Friday, with visits surging 27.5% and 26.6% above the YTD daily average, respectively. This highlights the brand’s ability to drive strong performance even with fewer promotions during peak seasons.</p>

<h3 id="short-stays-on-the-rise">Short Stays On The Rise</h3>
<p>As part of the effort to <a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/starbucks-reverses-open-door-policy-8774378">elevate</a> the in-store experience, Starbucks has also announced plans to implement a <a href="https://about.starbucks.com/code-of-conduct/">code of conduct</a>, with the goal of facilitating the creation of an “inviting and welcoming community coffeehouse.” One significant shift, coming into effect on January 27th, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxnv4rjdq4o">bars people</a> from lingering in its facilities without making a purchase. </p>
<p>A closer look at dwell time for the chain reveals that the vast majority of visits to the chain are currently less than 10 minutes long, with mobile orders making up <a href="https://s203.q4cdn.com/326826266/files/doc_financials/2024/q4/Q4-FY24-Digital-IR-Dashboard.pdf">almost a third</a> of total Starbucks orders. The predominance of short visits and the popularity of <a href="https://s203.q4cdn.com/326826266/files/doc_financials/2024/q4/Q4-FY24-Digital-IR-Dashboard.pdf">mobile orders</a> indicates that many Starbucks customers likely prioritize convenience, and prefer to grab a drink to go without taking advantage of the coffeehouse amenities. But with new incentives – including a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/starbucks-extending-free-refill-policy-all-customers-in-store-2025-1">free refill</a> policy for all customers, not just loyalty club members – dwell times may well go up over the coming months.  </p>

<p>Key Takeaways</p>
<ul>
<li>Visits to <strong>fried chicken restaurants</strong> have been on a major upward trend in recent months, with Q3 2024 visits elevated by 4.3% year-over-year (YoY) – far outpacing the performance of QSR and Fast-Casual restaurants. </li>
<li>Even fried chicken chains that have been in serious expansion mode over the past few years, like <strong>Dave’s Hot Chicken, Raising Cane’s Chicken Fingers, and Church’s Chicken,</strong> are continuing to drive increased visits per location to their stores – signifying that their new locations are meeting a strong demand. </li>
<li>Smaller fried chicken chains, including brands like <strong>Urban Bird Chicken</strong> and <strong>Layne’s Chicken Fingers,</strong> are also performing well YoY despite operating in a crowded market. </li>
</ul>
<p>Chicken restaurants have seen a huge surge in popularity over the past few years, from the epic <a href="https://www.placer.ai/blog/chicken-wars-update">Chicken Wars</a> of 2021 to the impressive stateside success of <a href="https://www.placer.ai/blog/making-it-in-america-international-chicken-chains-bring-the-heat">international</a> chains. And analyzing recent data indicates that fried chicken concepts are likely to continue as a top growth segment in 2025 as well. </p>
<p>We dove into the visit numbers to see how the segment is faring and highlighted some of the chains making the biggest splash. </p>
<h3 id="fried-battered-and-crispy">Fried, Battered, and Crispy</h3>
<p>In a dining segment that’s faced its fair share of <a href="https://www.placer.ai/blog/rbi-and-yum-qsr-resilience-in-2024">challenges</a> of late, chicken restaurant chains are standing out. Visits to QSR and fast-casual chicken chains consistently outperformed the wider fast-casual and QSR segments in terms of YoY visits, with the chicken category seeing a 4.3% YoY traffic boost in Q3 2024. </p>
<p>As diners continue to prioritize <a href="https://www.placer.ai/blog/c-stores-more-than-a-pit-stop">convenient</a> and affordable meals in the face of continued economic uncertainty, chicken-centric restaurants – which offer both <a href="https://www.placer.ai/blog/limited-time-offers-price-wars-boost-visits">value</a> and speed – seem well-positioned to continue thriving. </p>

<h3 id="a-clucking-success">A Clucking Success</h3>
<p>Diving into the visitation data for some of the category’s chicken leaders reveals that many of the bigger names in the game are not only growing their storefleet – they’re also continuing to drive more visits to each location. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.placer.ai/blog/7-retail-dining-segments-to-watch-in-2024">Dave’s Hot Chicken</a>, <a href="https://www.placer.ai/blog/7-retail-dining-segments-to-watch-in-2024">Raising Cane’s Chicken Fingers</a>, and Church’s Texas Chicken each attract millions of visits to their brick-and-mortar location every month – and traffic is steadily growing thanks to <a href="https://chainstoreage.com/churchs-texas-chicken-accelerates-remodeling-initiative-amid-expansion">the</a> <a href="https://www.eatthis.com/daves-hot-chicken-expansion-2024/">three</a> <a href="https://www.eatthis.com/raising-canes-expansion-plans-2024/">chains&#39;</a> expanding footprint. And location analytics reveal that these brands are also seeing strong growth in monthly visits per location – highlighting the impressive demand for fried chicken and showcasing these companies’ ability to grow their consumer base through fleet expansions.  </p>
<p><script src="https://embedded-widget.placer.ai/ew.js" async></script><iframe src="https://embedded-widget.placer.ai/widgets/v1/editorial/?type=infogram&id=_%2FzRaBjQUqOIfiE26Odefj&tag=blog_%7BChicken+Chains+See+Year-over-Year+Visit+Per+Location+Growth%7D" loading="lazy" title="Article Insights Graph" allowfullscreen="true" allow="clipboard-write" referrerpolicy="origin" scrolling="no" style="border: 1px solid rgb(229, 229, 229); border-radius: 8px; width:100%;height:600px;"></iframe></p>
<h3 id="size-isn-t-everything-smaller-chains-seeing-fried-chicken-success">Size Isn’t Everything: Smaller Chains Seeing Fried Chicken Success</h3>
<p>Another indication of the fried chicken market’s continued growth potential comes from the success of smaller brands flourishing alongside the category leaders. Chains like <a href="https://www.placer.ai/blog/making-it-in-america-international-chicken-chains-bring-the-heat">Pollo Campero</a>, Urban Bird Hot Chicken, Layne’s Chicken Fingers, and Super Chix may not be competing with industry leaders yet – but their impressive YoY visit growth highlights consumers’ current appetite for fried chicken franchises. </p>
<p>The four analyzed chains enjoyed strong monthly visits in 2024 relative to 2023, with November 2024 visits elevated between 13.1% and 29.1% YoY.</p>
<p>Whether these smaller chains are fueling their growth by offering an innovative twist on the traditional fried bird or benefiting from homegrown loyalty, the bottom line remains clear. Despite operating in a market that&#39;s getting more <a href="https://www.eatthis.com/fastest-growing-chicken-chains/">crowded</a> by the day, there&#39;s ample opportunity for new players to throw their feathered caps in the ring.</p>

<h3 id="the-top-of-the-pecking-order">The Top Of The Pecking Order</h3>
<p>The fried chicken segment remains a high-demand category, evidenced by the segment’s strong visit performance over the past year. With fried chicken chains continuing to expand across the country, will they maintain their visit dominance? Or will the cluck stop somewhere?</p>

<p>Key Takeaways</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Starbucks</strong> saw overall quarterly visits drop 1.6% in Q3 2024. But short visits – i.e. those lasting less than 10 minutes, grew 6.8% over the same period. In September 2024, short visits were up 4.7% year-over-year (YoY), even as overall visits dropped by 5.6%.</li>
<li>At <strong>Dutch Bros</strong>, too, short visits outperformed long ones in Q3 2024 – growing 25.6% YoY in Q3 2024, even as total visits increased 15.0%. In September 2024, YoY visits to <strong>Dutch Bros</strong> increased 13.7%, while short visits grew by a whopping 26.6%. </li>
<li>At both chains, short and long visits follow different weekly patterns: Longer visits (over ten minutes) tend to peak on Saturdays, while shorter visits are more evenly distributed throughout the week, peaking on Fridays. </li>
</ul>
<p>Starbucks, the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/Starbucks">largest</a> coffee chain in the world, and Dutch Bros, one of the <a href="https://www.costar.com/article/478265115/regional-dutch-bros-coffee-chain-brews-up-national-expansion">fastest</a> growing in the country, are major players in the hot and cold beverage space. With Q3 2024 in the rearview mirror, we took a closer look at the visitation patterns to both chains to see how they are faring – and what might lie ahead for both brands. </p>
<h3 id="starbucks-sees-stronger-short-stays">Starbucks Sees Stronger Short Stays</h3>
<p>Starbucks is one of the most dominant names in coffee across the world, with thousands of stores in the United States alone. Between July 2023 and July 2024, the chain added more than 500 <a href="https://s203.q4cdn.com/326826266/files/doc_financials/2023/q3/3Q23-Earnings-Release-Final-8-1-23.pdf">stores</a> to its domestic fleet, bringing its U.S. store <a href="https://s203.q4cdn.com/326826266/files/doc_financials/2024/q3/3Q24-Earnings-Release-Final-7-30-24.pdf">count</a> to 16,730. And though Starbucks has faced its share of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/22/business/starbucks-earnings-sales.html">challenges</a>, these store additions helped keep overall traffic to the coffee leader on par with 2023 levels throughout the summer – though visits dipped somewhat in September as consumers went back to their routines. </p>
<p>But digging deeper into the visit data shows that even as Starbucks saw overall foot traffic growth stall in Q3, the number of short visits to the chain – i.e. those lasting less than 10 minutes – increased. In August and September 2024, the chain drew 8.5% and 4.7% more short visits, respectively, than in the same periods of 2023 – revealing how important these quick stops are for the chain. </p>
<p>In-app ordering, which together with drive-thru orders made up about <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/03/food/starbucks-reusable-cup-expansion/index.html">70% of sales</a> at the chain as of January 2024, may be contributing to the short visit trend. Still, new CEO Brian Niccol is looking for ways to return the chain to its roots as the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/starbucks-new-ceo-wants-customers-spend-more-time-coffee-chain-2024-9">third place</a>, and the chain may yet implement shifts to encourage longer visits in the coming months. </p>

<h3 id="dutch-bros-brings-the-visits">Dutch Bros Brings The Visits</h3>
<p>Dutch Bros has been one of the most impressive coffee chains to watch over the past few years. The Oregon-based chain has been on an expansion tear – opening more than <a href="https://investors.dutchbros.com/news/news-details/2024/Dutch-Bros-Inc.-Reports-Second-Quarter-2024-Financial-Results/default.aspx">150</a> stores between Q2 2023 and Q2 2024 – and has seen the elevated monthly visits to match. Between June and September 2024, visits to Dutch Bros increased between 13.7% and 16.9%, highlighting the chain’s success at growing its audience.</p>
<p>But like at Starbucks, short visits outperformed longer ones at Dutch Bros – and by a lot. In September 2024, for example, overall visits to the chain grew by 13.7% – but visits lasting less than 10 minutes shot up by 26.6%. </p>
<p>The strength of these short visits, for both Starbucks and Dutch Bros, suggests a shift towards convenience, with both chains utilizing drive-thru services and in-app ordering to accommodate busy consumers. </p>
<p><script src="https://embedded-widget.placer.ai/ew.js" async></script><iframe src="https://embedded-widget.placer.ai/widgets/v1/editorial/?type=infogram&id=_%2FnGy0E0YxzdTBpfRzS5H1&tag=blog_%7BShort+Visits+Drive+YoY+Visit+Growth+at+Dutch+Bros.%7D" loading="lazy" title="Article Insights Graph" allowfullscreen="true" allow="clipboard-write" referrerpolicy="origin" scrolling="no" style="border: 1px solid rgb(229, 229, 229); border-radius: 8px; width:100%;height:600px;"></iframe></p>
<h3 id="weekends-lead-to-lingering-visitors">Weekends Lead To Lingering Visitors</h3>
<p>Digging down deeper into the data shows that for both Starbucks and Dutch Bros, these all-important short visits follow a distinct weekly pattern.</p>
<p>While longer visits (≥10 minutes) to both chains peaked in Q3 2024 on Saturdays, shorter visits were more evenly distributed throughout the week, peaking on Fridays. Overall, 34.1% of long visits to Starbucks, and 37.8% of long visits to Dutch Bros, took place on the weekends in Q3 2024 – compared to 28.1% and and 28.7%, respectively, for shorter visits. </p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, customers may be more likely to grab a quick coffee to go during the work week. And with the return to office still underway, quick visits may be enjoying a boost fueled by commuters in need of a quick cubicle pick-me-up. </p>
<p><script src="https://embedded-widget.placer.ai/ew.js" async></script><iframe src="https://embedded-widget.placer.ai/widgets/v1/editorial/?type=infogram&id=_%2F8Hw5OVnPaClIvq3G3EyS&tag=blog_%7BShort+Visits+Are+More+Evenly+Distributed+Throughout+the+Week+at+Both+Starbucks+and+Dutch+Bros.+%E2%80%93+While+Longer+Ones+are+More+Heavily+Concentrated+on+Weekends%7D" loading="lazy" title="Article Insights Graph" allowfullscreen="true" allow="clipboard-write" referrerpolicy="origin" scrolling="no" style="border: 1px solid rgb(229, 229, 229); border-radius: 8px; width:100%;height:600px;"></iframe></p>
<h3 id="final-sips">Final Sips</h3>
<p>​​As Starbucks works to adapt to shifting consumer preferences, understanding when customers spend more time in-store can help the brand reconnect with its roots as a community hub. And Dutch Bros can continue to enhance the quick-service experience that has fueled its growth. How will the two chains continue to perform in what remains a competitive coffee environment?</p>
