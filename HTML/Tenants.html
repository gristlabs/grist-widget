<p>January 30, 2025</p>

<p>They say that one man’s trash is another one’s treasure – and for Burlington Stores, opportunity knocked when Bed Bath &amp; Beyond selected Burlington Stores as the successful bidder for many of its leases, with the latter taking over 44 locations for $12 million. Per <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/29/burlington-stores-will-replace-bed-bath-beyond-locations.html">CNBC</a>, many of these new venues are scattered across the country.</p>
<p>Using Placer data, we are able to compare visitation trends to these locations when they were branded as a Bed Bath &amp; Beyond store versus when the new leases took over.</p>
<p>Whereas the top four segments have remained consistent for both banners, Burlington attracts a higher proportion of Melting Pot Families - over 2x the rate compared to when it was a Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.</p>

<p>The number of visits across numerous visit durations was considerably higher to Burlington, and the average dwell time increased to 41 minutes compared to 31 minutes when it was a Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.</p>

<script src="https://embedded-widget.placer.ai/ew.js" async></script><iframe src="https://embedded-widget.placer.ai/widgets/v1/editorial/?type=infogram&id=_%2FPg6xRamLRsbfAsKMjVEZ&title=Average+Dwell+Time+increased+10+min+upon+change+to+Burlington&tag=undefined" loading="lazy" title="Average Dwell Time increased 10 min upon change to Burlington" allowfullscreen="true" allow="clipboard-write" referrerpolicy="origin" scrolling="no" style="border: 1px solid rgb(229, 229, 229); border-radius: 8px; width:100%;height:600px;"></iframe>

<p>While this is just one example of a Burlington takeover, it goes to show that while the location may stay the same, the audience it attracts  will vary and this Burlington is off to an excellent start.</p>

<p>January 28, 2025</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62d64ff33158a9a2aba96531/6797c0174613d6eccc696ae2_McDonalds%20_%20Chipotle.png" alt="McDonald’s &amp; Chipotle: Recapping 2024 Visit Trends"></p>
<p>Key Takeaways</p>
<ul>
<li>Year-over-year (YoY) foot traffic to <strong>McDonald’s</strong> was mixed in 2024, with most months experiencing minor lags in visits relative to 2023. Still, the restaurant outperformed the wider quick-service restaurant (QSR) segment in all months analyzed. </li>
<li><strong>McDonald’s</strong> used limited-time offers (LTOs) to great effect throughout 2024, with its <strong>Chicken Big Mac</strong> release driving the largest and most sustained visit boost relative to 2024’s average weekly visits. </li>
<li><strong>Chipotle</strong> outperformed the wider fast-casual segment, experiencing YoY visit growth in all months analyzed. </li>
<li><strong>Chipotle’s</strong> expansion has met a ready demand as new venues seem to fill up fast – all but eight states in the continental U.S. showed growth in visits per location in 2024 relative to 2023.</li>
</ul>
<p>How have McDonald’s and Chipotle, two of the most recognizable names in the quick-service and fast-casual dining scenes, fared over the last year? We take a closer look at each chain’s visit performance, and highlight some bright spots of 2024. </p>
<h3 id="mcdonald-s-visits-vary-outperform-overall-qsr">McDonald’s: Visits Vary, Outperform Overall QSR</h3>
<p>Visits to McDonald’s were mixed throughout 2024, with most months seeing minor visitation lags relative to 2023. Still, YoY traffic trends outpaced those of the overall QSR segment in all but one month (October 2024), highlighting the chain’s power relative to the rest of the market. </p>

<h3 id="specials-drive-visits">Specials Drive Visits</h3>
<p>Some of the visitation dips at both McDonald&#39;s and the overall QSR segment are likely due to inflation impacting prices across the dining industry. And the rise of the budget-conscious consumer has prompted many chains to lean on limited-time offers and special releases to both offer affordable deals and turn a trip to a QSR into a special occasion. McDonald’s capitalized on this trend, driving <a href="https://www.placer.ai/blog/limited-time-offers-price-wars-boost-visits">impressive</a> visit boosts following the June launch of its $5 Meal Deal. However, it was the chain’s special releases that delivered the most significant increases in weekly visits.</p>
<p>The introduction of the <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/03/food/mcdonalds-chicken-big-mac/index.html">Chicken Big Mac</a> on October 10th, 2024 proved to be a major success, driving a 7.2% increase in visits during the week of the launch (October 7th-13th) and an even larger 8.7% increase in the first full week following the release (October 14th-20th). The chain also enjoyed a jump in foot traffic from its limited-edition collector’s meal, <a href="https://www.scrippsnews.com/life/food-and-drink/mcdonalds-launches-limited-edition-collectors-meal-heres-whats-inside">launched</a> on August 12th, 2024, further highlighting the effectiveness of these strategic, <a href="https://www.placer.ai/blog/mcdonalds-and-chipotles-post-pandemic-success">nostalgia</a>-driven releases.</p>

<h3 id="chipotle-wrapping-up-another-impressive-year">Chipotle: Wrapping Up Another Impressive Year</h3>
<p>Chipotle has been a fast-casual darling for several years now, consistently driving YoY visit growth and expanding into new markets. And 2024 was no exception for the chain, with visits growing in all months analyzed. This included an impressive 21.1% year-over-year increase in April 2024, followed by sustained growth throughout the remainder of the year, culminating in an 8.8% increase in December 2024 compared to 2023. In contrast, the broader fast-casual category saw much more muted visitation patterns. </p>

<h3 id="growing-across-the-country">Growing Across The Country</h3>
<p>Some of Chipotle’s visit growth can be attributed to the aggressive growth strategy the company has undertaken, opening <a href="https://www.costar.com/article/2005466952/chipotle-on-track-to-open-record-number-of-stores-during-rough-year-for-restaurants">approximately</a> 300 stores in 2024 with plans to add another 300 locations in 2025. A significant part of this expansion strategy focuses on rural and suburban markets in a bid to capture untapped demand beyond traditional urban hubs.</p>
<p>And diving into visits per location reveals that, overall, this strategy is working. All but eight states analyzed showed YoY visit per location growth in 2024 – and five of the top ten states for visits per location growth are among the <a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/state-densities">least</a> densely populated in the country. This suggests that Chipotle&#39;s decision to target smaller markets is paying off, enabling the brand to attract new audiences while reinforcing its stronghold in more densely populated areas.</p>

<li>On a quarterly basis, visits to <strong>Yum! Brands</strong> were generally up in 2024, with Q4 2024 seeing a year-over-year (YoY) 0.8% increase in visits and 1.6% growth in visits per location</li>
<li>Overall quarterly visits to <strong>RBI</strong> banners hovered at or just below 2023 levels for most of 2024.</li>

<li>Yum! Brands <strong>Taco Bell</strong> &amp; <strong>Pizza Hut</strong> enjoyed consistent visit growth in all quarters of 2024, likely buoyed by successful promotions and limited-time offers. </li>
</ul>
<p>RBI and Yum! Brands own and operate some of the country’s most beloved and well-known dining chains. We took a look at the visit data for 2024 to see how the two companies fared in a period of economic headwinds and uncertainty. </p>
<h3 id="dining-leaders">Dining Leaders</h3>
<p>Restaurant Brands International (RBI) and Yum! Brands are leaders in the fast food and fast casual dining segment. Each company operates four restaurants with major footprints across the country – RBI owns Tim Hortons, Burger King, Firehouse Subs, and Popeyes, and Yum! manages Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, KFC, and The Habit Burger Grill.</p>
<p>Yum! Brands enjoyed visit and visits per location growth in all but one quarter, capping off Q4 2024 with an 0.8% increase in visits and a 1.6% increase in visits per location on a YoY basis. RBI’s visits and visits per location, meanwhile, hovered at or just below 2023’s levels in all but one quarter of the year, highlighting the challenges facing the dining segment in 2024.</p>

<h3 id="mixed-visits-popeye-s-stands-out">Mixed Visits, Popeye’s Stands Out</h3>
<p>Of the four RBI brands, Popeyes enjoyed the strongest visitation patterns throughout 2024.The chain has been a standout for the past few years – likely owing to its popular <a href="https://www.placer.ai/blog/popeyes-and-burger-king-lead-the-way">chicken sandwiches</a> – and Popeyes performed well in 2024 as well, with YoY visit growth during most quarters. </p>
<p>Following Popeyes in visit growth was Tim Hortons – Canada’s leading coffee chain – which saw positive momentum in the first half of 2024, though visits dipped in the latter half of the year. And though Burger King’s visits were sluggish, the chain has been focusing on optimizing its store fleets with <a href="https://www.placer.ai/blog/rbi-and-yum-qsr-resilience-in-2024">strong</a> results.</p>
<p>While overall visits across RBI’s brands were slightly below 2023 levels, their ability to remain close to last year’s numbers – and even achieve growth in some quarters – signals resilience. </p>

<h3 id="yum-brands-promotions-boost-visits">Yum! Brands: Promotions Boost Visits</h3>
<p>Yum! Brands delivered a strong performance in 2024, buoyed by Pizza Hut and Taco Bell’s consistent growth. Taco Bell in particular stood out, driving foot traffic through promotions like its highly popular <a href="https://www.placer.ai/blog/serving-summer-2024-rbi-and-yum-brands-q2-foot-traffic">Taco Tuesday</a> special. The chain experienced quarterly YoY visit growth throughout the year, culminating in a 2.1% increase in Q4 2024 relative to 2023.</p>
<p>Pizza Hut also experienced impressive visitation growth in 2024, especially in Q2. In contrast, KFC faced challenges with declining visits, while The Habit Burger Grill’s traffic remained steady, closely tracking 2023 levels. </p>

<h3 id="stabilizing-visits-room-for-growth">Stabilizing Visits, Room For Growth</h3>
<p>RBI and Yum! Brands experienced ups and downs throughout 2024, with some of their chains thriving while others showed modest visit declines. </p>
<p>With the new year well underway, how might RBI and Yum! work to drive increased visits to their restaurants?</p>
